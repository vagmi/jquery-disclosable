Disclosable Panel
-----------------

It is a very simple JQuery plugin which works with JQuery UI and does not define it own classes. You can use it as follows.

    $('div#someid').disclosable();

It uses the JQuery UI themes. I have tested it with redmond and smoothness themes but it should work with any theme rolled out with themeroller.
